REFERNECE VARIABLES:
    Declaration of reference variables is preceded with '&' symbol but it is not readed as address
INLINE FUNCTION:
    1.to eliminate the cost of code to small function c++ proposes new feature called inline function.
    2.inline function is fn that is expnded inline when it is invoked
    3.compiler replaces fn call with corresponding fn code.
    4.it is a request not a command so compiler can also ignore the request
    ex.
      inline void fun()//Function declaration
      void main()
      {
          cout<<"Hello world";
          fun();
      }
      void fun()
      {
          cout<<"my name is aman";
      }
  FUNCTION OVERLOADING:
    1.when one function name  is overloaded with different function jobs then it is said to be function overloading means writing same function name in the code.
    How function overloading is resolved?
    1.find exact match this is done by matching the paramateres from the overloaded  function.
     Ex.#include<iostream>
     using namespace std;
    int fun(int a,int b,int c)
    {
	    return a+b+c;
	
    }
   float fun(int r){
      return (3.14*r*r);
    }

    int main()
    {
	    cout<<fun(2,3,4)<<endl;
	    cout<<fun(2);
    }
    2.if no exact match is found then c++ does by promotion:
      char,unsigned char is promoted to int
      float to double
    3.if no promotion is found then standard deviation comes into picture in which any data type is converted to other data type.

   1. Left shift (x<<y) means shift x, y times to left or simply x*2^y.
   2. Rigth Shift( x>>y) means shift x, y times to right or simply x/2^y.
   3. int to char: a+'0'
   4.char to int:  int(ch-'0')  or ch-'0'
